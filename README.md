# The Travelling Salesman Problem
A application in c++ to solve the _Travelling Salesman Problem_ using ACO (Ant Colony System, a Meta-Heuristic and approximation algorithm).


## Abstract

The travelling Salesman Problem is a problem about, given a set of cities, find the shortest route visiting all the cities, ending in the same city that you start. This problem is a _NP_Hard problem_ , so there isnt a algorithm that solve the problem in polynomial time. But, we can use algorithms and use metaheuristics to try to find a good a aproximation to the optimal solution. In this case I was hesitating between choosing, a Swarm algorithm, in specific _the Ant Colony System_ or a evolutionary algorithm, _the Genetic algorithm_. In the end I have decided to use _the Ant Colony System_ because I think that the general approach of this algorithm i'ts more similar and natural to apply to the _Travelling Salesman Problem_ and _the Ant Colony System_ was designed to for use with combinatorial problems, just like _The Travelling Salesman problem_.
